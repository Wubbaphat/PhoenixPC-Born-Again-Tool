✅ NVIDIA Power Management Mode (Graphics Settings)

Choose between “Balanced” and “Prefer Maximum Performance” based on your needs:

Balanced (Recommended for most users):
Lets your GPU dynamically adjust clock speeds and power usage based on current workload.

Saves power and reduces heat/noise when idle or under light use.

Extends hardware lifespan by avoiding constant high load.

Ideal for everyday use, watching videos, casual gaming, or general tasks.


Prefer Maximum Performance:
Keeps the GPU running at higher clock speeds all the time, preventing downclocking during light use.

Ensures maximum frame rate consistency for gaming, streaming, or GPU-intensive tasks.

Can reduce frame drops or stuttering in demanding applications.

Increases power consumption, heat generation, and fan noise.

Not recommended if your main goal is to save system resources or reduce energy use.



> Best practice: Set “Balanced” globally and configure “Prefer Maximum Performance” only for specific apps (e.g., OBS, games) in NVIDIA Control Panel → Manage 3D Settings → Program Settings.



📍 NVIDIA Control Panel → Manage 3D Settings → Power Management Mode
