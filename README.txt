⚙️ Core Features

🧠 Flush DNS
Clears the DNS cache to fix connection and loading issues.

🌐 Restart Network Stack
Restarts core networking components to fix connection problems.

🗂️ Restart Windows Explorer
Fixes freezing, unresponsive taskbars, and desktop issues.

🧹 Clear Temporary Files
Frees disk space by deleting temp system/user files.

💾 Clear Standby Memory (Requires RAMMap)
Flushes cached memory that slows performance over time.

🧠 Optimize RAM Usage (Requires ReduceMemory)
Frees up RAM consumed by idle or background processes.

🔌 Reinitialize Device Drivers (Requires DevCon)
Uses DevCon to soft-restart selected hardware (e.g., audio, GPU, USB), helpful after driver crashes or resets.

🕒 Repeat Task Timer
A built-in interval timer allows selected tasks to run repeatedly at user-defined intervals. This is useful for ongoing optimization or monitoring — for example, keeping RAM usage low during heavy multitasking or automatically flushing DNS every few minutes. The timer runs until manually stopped.

🗂️ Launch Task Manager
Toggle to instantly open/close the Task Manager from the app to help you monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network activity in real time. This is especially useful when troubleshooting slowdowns or verifying the effects of optimization tasks.

💾 Auto-Save Configuration
The app automatically saves your tool paths, settings, preferences and your location on screen — so everything is ready next time you launch.

⚠️ Minimize to Tray
Keeps the app running quietly in the system tray, hiding the main window and taskbar button for a clean desktop.

1. Select Tasks
Use the checkboxes to choose any combination of fixes you want to run.


2. Set Tool Paths (Optional)

These are saved in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Phoenix PC SoftReboot for future use — no need to re-enter them every time.


3. Click “Run Selected Tasks”
The utility executes selected tasks in order.


4. Review the Output Log
Real-time status updates will appear in the output box.
